Revision history for Perl extension Search::HiLiter.

0.01  Thu Jun 22 08:06:59 2006
	- original version

0.02
    * added example/ scripts
    * fixed S::T::K SYNOPSIS to reflect reality
    * POD fixes
    * added is_valid_utf8() method to S::T::Transliterate
      along with valid utf8 check in convert()
    * rewrote S::T::Keywords logic to:
        * correctly parse stopwords (all are compared with lc())
        * return phrases as phrases
        * additional UTF-8 checks
        * parse according to RegExp character definitions
    * changed default UTF8Char regexp in S::T::RegExp
    * changed default WordChar regexp in S::T::RegExp
    * begin_characters and end_characters are no longer supported
      since they were logically just the inverse of ignore_*_char plus
      word_characters. The entire regexp construction was refactored
      with that in mind.
    * @Search::Tools::Accessors now provides (saner) way for subclasses
      to inherit attributes like word_characters, stemmer, stopwords, etc.
    * S::T::RegExp kw_opts is no longer supported
    * stopwords are intentionally left in phrases, as are special boolean words
    * added ->phrase accessor to S::T::R::Keyword
    * S::T::HiLiter now higlights all phrases before singles so that
      any overlap privileges the phrase match. Example would be 'foo and "foo bar"'
      where the phrase "foo bar" should receive precedence over single word 'foo'.
