<p align="center"><strong><font color="#000000">President Mbeki addresses the nation on Freedom Day </font></strong></p>
<p> <font color="#000000">"Fellow South Africans,</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We need to dedicate ourselves to the building of a socially cohesive nation, always working to create a common identity as South Africans, united in diversity, bound together by the same vision of creating a truly non-racial, non-sexist society based on the values of ubuntu.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Clearly, all sectors of society should join forces in a national partnership to achieve social cohesion and build national unity.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">While priding ourselves on the successes we have made since the dawn of freedom, we equally have a duty to reflect on the challenges that we still have to do, especially the eradication of the legacy of our odious past.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"> Indeed, since the onset of freedom and democracy in our country we have traversed a long and arduous journey of bringing together a nation until then fractured by a deeply entrenched system of institutionalised racism.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">However, to accelerate our efforts towards a non-racial and non-sexist society and build a better life for all, means working in partnerships to fight the legacy of apartheid in all its manifestations. It means that we must fight racism wherever it appears - at the workplaces, in business, at schools, in the media, in the streets, at the dinner-tables, in public and private institutions and in every part of our country and society.</font></p>
<p align="center">To read the rest of President Mbeki's speech, follow the 'Read More' link below </p><br><br>
	    <p><font color="#000000">Further, freedom and democracy gave birth to a culture of human rights in South Africa. At the centre of the new culture of human rights is the promotion of non-sexism and non-racialism. We therefore, call upon all South Africans to work in partnership, especially with institutions such as Commission for Gender Equality, Human Rights Commission and others for the promotion, protection, development and attainment of human rights.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Three years into the Second Decade of Freedom, let us renew the pledge we made as a nation as we entered the decade, to build a national partnership to advance faster towards a better life for all.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The progress we made in the last thirteen years of freedom laid the foundation for us to move still faster towards a better life for all and to halve poverty and unemployment by 2014.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Let all of us, on this day, the Freedom Day, rededicate ourselves to build a better society in which we can defeat poverty, unemployment, homelessness and economic marginalisation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Together, government, business, traditional leaders, women, youth and workers should help the rural poor with simple yet critical programmes that would alleviate poverty and hunger. Together let us help to set-up and strengthen community gardens, co-operatives, small and medium enterprises and structures aimed at the up-liftment of our people in the rural areas.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">It means that government's expanded public works programme should be accelerated and services to rural areas radically improved, so as to continue changing for the better the living conditions of the mass of our people in the rural areas, so that they can also feel that while today is better than yesterday, tomorrow will bring more joy than today.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In this regard, all of us as South Africans - business, women, youth and both the public servants and public representatives, should rededicate ourselves to building a caring nation.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Today, on the occasion of the celebrations of our freedom, we renew our partnership committed to working with business for a growing economy that benefits all, an economy that creates the resources necessary to push back the frontiers of poverty.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Together, let us ensure that our economy achieves higher rates of growth and that all the people of this country share in this growth; that our businesses re-invest in our economy, in this way helping to create more jobs and thereby fight poverty.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Together - government, institutions of higher learning and business - let us strengthen efforts aimed at addressing the shortage of skills in our country.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Together, we must work hard to tackle the challenges of our second economy and ensure that measures aimed at addressing the specific needs of the millions who subsist in this economy are effective, so that these masses of our people can also become part of the first economy and enjoy its benefits.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">To work in partnership to build a better life for all means that all of us should be committed to the implementation of policies aimed at bringing black people into the mainstay of the economy and therefore help implement policies on affirmative action and broad-based black economic empowerment.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Compatriots,</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">To strengthen our democracy means the emancipation and empowerment of women. This empowerment must happen at home, at school, at work, in business, in the media, in government and in society in general.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">To achieve this empowerment means women must be prioritised in job-creation, in business development and in the broad-based black economic empowerment.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">As government, we will continue to work with our social partners to promote the economic empowerment of women in terms of access to finance, fast-tracking of skills development at all levels and in government procurement.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We will strengthen our capacity to focus on the challenge of making it easy for women to access the opportunities created by the policies and programmes in place.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In whatever we do we should ensure that the role of women in the consolidation our freedom and democracy is high on the national agenda.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Equally, we call on all our youth across the spectrum of society to ensure that they work hard to consolidate the advances that we are making as a nation, advances that they, themselves, will proudly inherit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We reiterate our call for our youth to act as a vanguard against crime, against drug abuse, against woman and child abuse; to set their sights on education and obtain scarce skills that our country require.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our youth should take advantage of opportunities presented by government and working with the National Youth Commission, cultivate a spirit, culture and ethos of working among our people, of dedication and service to the people. They should also use Umsobomvu to become real entrepreneurs that are much needed in the economic sphere of our country.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Three years into the Second Decade of Freedom, let us renew the pledge we made as a nation as we entered the decade, to build a national partnership to advance faster towards a better life for all.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In this regard, the transformation of the public service has brought progress in creating a government that serves all the people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Yet, our public representatives and civil servants must take it upon themselves to better serve all South Africans efficiently and with dedication and pride, in the spirit of Batho Pele, doing so in the full knowledge that they are fulfilling the critical role of helping create a caring and better society.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Fellow South Africans,</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Freedom Day is an important day in our national life. It symbolises the dawn of freedom and democracy. It represents a call to sustain the national effort that brought about freedom, which is critical in consolidating our democracy and promoting non-sexism and non-racialism. It enjoins us to fight and defeat crime and corruption. It calls on all South Africans to unite and defeat poverty and underdevelopment. It calls on all of us to work in partnership for a better future.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Let us therefore renew our pledge of a national partnership to build a better life for all. Wherever you are, I wish you a happy Freedom Day.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Thank you"</font></p><br><br>
