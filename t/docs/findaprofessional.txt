THE DIRECTORIES OF CHOICE "Traditional Yellow Pages suffer the two great drawbacks of paper: They can provide only one way of organizing information, and they have so little room. When all you have to go on is a company's name - or maybe the promotional information in a display ad - you might as well just pick the first one listed. For businesses that have worked hard to provide genuine competitive advantages - faster service, better-trained employees, maybe generations of building a good reputation - getting trumped by the guy's who put five A's in their name is a cruel practical joke enabled by the limitations of paper." David Weinberger World renowned Marketing Consultant to Fortune 500 Companies, and contributor to the Harvard Business Review The days of looking up a professional in a traditional name-and-number directory are completely outdated and inadequate for today s informed and proactive consumer. People need information, a background of who they re dealing with, and what they really specialise in. Simply choosing the professional that just happens to be your cousin s husband s best friend from university is no longer necessarily the best way to go. The Finda suite of websites fills this gap and is fast becoming the number one point-of-entry for astute members of the South African public needing professional services.
