In an effort to boost the economy and help &amp;quot;&amp;quot;main street,&amp;quot;&amp;quot; why doesn't the Wall Street bail out plan include some reasonableness measures for consumer credit? I am not talking about 5% interest rates, but limiting the Washington-backed loan shark tactics that are pervasive in the credit card and consumer loan &amp;quot;&amp;quot;rackets&amp;quot;&amp;quot; would go a long way to reducing credit problems of the same people who are now having trouble paying their mortgages. A national &amp;quot;&amp;quot;regular&amp;quot;&amp;quot; interest limit of 12% and a default rate of 18% would put an end to the cycle of 32% interest rates, late fees, collection calls and the downward spiral that is so common for the overextended middle class. My two cents.
